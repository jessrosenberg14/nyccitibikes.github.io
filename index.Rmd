## The motivation for this project
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, CitiBikes played an integral role in helping to transport critical workers around NYC, and many New Yorkers switched from riding the subway regularly to seeking alternative transportation methods. We are interested in understanding how transportation trends (both CitiBike and MTA) changed across NYC due to the pandemic.

## Timeline of COVID Events

In the early days of the pandemic, our understanding of COVID-19 changed daily, if not hourly. The below timeline is a helpful reminder of major events of 2020. 

```{r}
